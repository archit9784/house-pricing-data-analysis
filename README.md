HOW TO BUILD THE PROJECT
 step 1: Firsty build a machine learning model by using dataset of houses from kaggle.
 step 2: Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests.
 step 3: The website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc. 
 step 4: It will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
 STEP5 5: when you get local host url then copy the url in that manner (http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict_home_price)
